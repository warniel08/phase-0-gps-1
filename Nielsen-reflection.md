#My Reflection of GPS 1.1

Answer these questions in your reflection:

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    * I was still struggling a little with the git fetch, git merge, and the merge conflict concepts.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    * All of the concepts were clarified and solidified during the GPS. It was very helpful and I'm glad I was able to participate in this.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    * I asked any question that would come to my mind. I asked clarifying questions on each of the concepts that I struggle with, just to make sure that I understood what was going on and how it worked. I don't remember specific questions but any time I had a question I would ask.

4. What still confuses you about Git?
    * I guess I'm still a little confused at how Git works with a huge team. I understand the overall direction that Git takes and directing the workflow, but until I see it in a larger team I won't be as comfortable with it and how it all comes together. Just takes experience in that arena.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    * I loved it. Even though my pair didn't show up, my guide, Lawson, was awesome and helped me out a ton. It was great.
